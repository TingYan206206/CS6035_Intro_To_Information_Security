#Small key space#
In the real world, a commonly used RSA key size is 1024 bits, which makes it hard
for attackers to traverse the whole key space with limited resources. Now, you're given an
unique RSA public key, of which the key size is pretty small (64 bits), your goal is to get
the private key.

You're given a RSA public key, get the private key.
Complete the two TODOs in "get_pri_key.py".
To run "get_pri_key.py", please run:
	- python get_pri_key.py your_id

Submission:
1. private key, in hex format, replace the "task2" value in submission json. (10)
2. get_pri_key.py file.
3. an explanation about how you get the private key in report. (10)
