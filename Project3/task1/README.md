py#Get familiar with RSA#


The goal of this task is to get you familiar with RSA.
You're given a RSA key pair (N; e) and d, and an unique encrypted message c. You're
required to get the decrypted message m

You're given a RSA key pair and a encrypted message, you're required to get the decrypted message.

To get your key pair:
	-- Run "python get_name_hash.py student_id" to get your name's hash value, for example, 
	since my id is "qchenxiong3", so I run "python get_name_hash.py qchenxiong3".
	-- Now, you can get your key pair and encrypted message from "keys4student.json" based on your name's
	hash value.

submission:
	-- the plain text in hex format, for example, 0x4242424242, replace the "task1" value in the submission json file. (10)
