RSA is one of the most widely used public key cryptosystems in the world. It's com-
posed of three algorithms: key generation (Gen), encryption (Enc), and decryption (Dec).
In RSA, the public key is a pair of integers (e, N), and the private key is an integer d.
Gen The key pair is generated by the following steps:
1. Choose two distinct big prime numbers with the same bit size, say p and q.
2. Let N = p * q, and o(N) = (p - 1) * (q - 1).
3. Pick up an integer e, such that 1 < e < o(N) and gcd(e,o(N)) = 1.
4. Get the modular inverse of e: d = e-1 mod (N) (i.e., d * e = 1 mod (N)).
5. Return (N; e) as public key, and d as private key.
Enc To encrypt integer m with public key (N; e), the cipher integer c = me mod N.
Dec To decrypt cipher integer c with private key d, the plain integer m = cd mod N.

In this project, we have 4 task to pratice. Be familiar with RSA, attack small key, get private key, and bradcasting RSA attack.
